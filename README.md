# Endive

## Event prediction library for Python 
Event prediction problems are very similar to time-series prediction problems. Given a set of data and a particular target event, we'd like to determine a sequence of events that indicates the presence of the target event. Endive is a rare event prediction library for Python that uses a genetic algorithm to predict the most optimal predictive pattern by evaluating it a recall metric, which measures the percentage of target events that a particular predictive pattern accurately determines.
